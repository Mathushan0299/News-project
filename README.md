# News Classification System

## Overview
The **News Classification System** is a machine learning project designed to classify news articles into predefined categories such as Sports, Technology, Politics, Entertainment, etc. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze and categorize news based on the content of the articles.

## Features
- **Automated classification of news articles**
- **Preprocessing of text data using NLP techniques**
- **Training and evaluation of machine learning models**
- **Support for multiple news categories**
- **Real-time classification (if applicable)**

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas` (for data manipulation)
  - `scikit-learn` (for machine learning algorithms)
  - `nltk` (for text preprocessing)
  - `tensorflow/keras` (if you're using neural networks)
  - `matplotlib/seaborn` (for data visualization)
- **Dataset**: [Include a link if you are using a public dataset, e.g., the BBC News Dataset]

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Install the required Python libraries by running:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/news-classification.git
    ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd news-classification
    ```
3. Run the Python script to start the classification process:
    ```bash
    python classify_news.py
    ```

## Usage

### Training the Model
1. Preprocess the dataset by running:
    ```bash
    python preprocess.py
    ```
2. Train the model on the dataset:
    ```bash
    python train_model.py
    ```

### Testing the Model
To test the model on a set of news articles:
```bash
python test_model.py
